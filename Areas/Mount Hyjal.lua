{["title"] = "Circle of Cinders"	,["x"] = 43.90	,["y"] = 27.00	,["lore"] = "When Ragnaros was ripped from the Elemental Plane by the Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan, several subjects from the Firelands followed in his wake.\nBaron Geddon fought against the titans and aided in the betrayal of Thunderaan, Prince of Air.\nThe Firelord devoured the essence of the prince, but was unable to consume him entirely.\nThus, the remaining energies were trapped within a talisman of elemental binding, which Ragnaros split into two perfect halves which he gave to his two lieutenants.\nRumour has it that Executus supplanted Baron Geddon, and the two have been rivals ever since.\nAlthough this rumour has yet to be confirmed, there is certainly no doubt that Ragnaros does not tolerate failure.\nThus, the lesser flamewakers (and, of course, Baron Geddon) eagerly awaited a misstep by Executus, anticipating their chance to vie for the coveted attention of the Firelord.\n\nBaron Geddon guarded one half of the talisman deep within the fiery confines of Blackrock Depths.\nThough the two have fought side by side for countless millennia, Baron Geddon harbored suspicious that Garr would seek to supplant him as the sole guardian of the talisman.\nGeddon, therefore, remained ever cautious of his former comrade.\nIn fact, it was Shazzrah who sought to posses both halves of the talisman so that he might find a way to siphon its energies for his own use.\n\nGeddon also taught a fire elemental by the name of Lord Incendius to harness his destructive powers, but the baron never expected his protégé to grow so lethally efficient.\nIncreasingly wary that Incendius might usurp him, Geddon sent the blazing elemental out of the Molten Core to guard the Dark Iron dwarves' fabled Black Anvil.\n\nSome years after the defeat in the Molten Core, Baron returned with Ragnaros' assault on Mount Hyjal."}
{["title"] = "Shrine of Goldrinn"	,["x"] = 29.68	,["y"] = 29.13	,["lore"] = "The Shrine of Goldrinn is a shrine built to honor the wolf god Goldrinn, or Lo'Gosh in orcish.\nLo'Gosh is an Ancient Guardian, one of several demigods on Azeroth.\nHe takes the form of a monstrously powerful white wolf and embodies ferocity, savagery, and an unyielding will.\nGoldrinn was worshipped by the Druids of the Scythe, who helped create the Scythe of Elune using one of Goldrinn's fangs and the staff of Elune.\nThey intended to use the scythe to tame their feral spirits, but were instead transformed into bestial, humanoid worgen.\n\nGoldrinn was already ten thousand years old when the Burning Legion first invaded Azeroth.\nThe white wolf Ancient slaughtered hundreds of demons before he fell in the invasion.\nHe is said to have aided the night elves of Eldre'Thalas in holding their city against the Burning Legion, only to vanish after battle, never to be seen again.\nHis legend extends throughout Azeroth to elves, trolls, goblins, tauren, and dwarves — who all have their own version of the story.\nIn each tale, the ancient's unyielding will and sheer ferocity enabled him to push through the boundaries of the afterlife to aid his people.\nThis may be metaphorical however, since Tyrande 's vision, which recounted the events of Goldrinn's death, depicts his mortal wolf progeny continuing his legacy by pressing on the fight against the Burning Legion after he fell in battle.\n\nHis \"spirit\" seems to live on, favoring and inhabiting the human king, Varian Wrynn.\nIt is suspected that Goldrinn not only admired Varian's ferocity, but also his ability to tame it; something he himself was never able to do.\nWhereas Goldrinn's noble heart was overshadowed by his desire for bloodlust and vengeance, Varian's ferocity was tempered by his desire to protect and uphold justice.\nHis choice to champion Varian seems to be another last redeeming act to Elune."}
{["title"] = "Shrine of Aviana"		,["x"] = 43.96	,["y"] = 46.16	,["scale"] = 2	,["lore"] = "Shrine of Aviana is a shrine built to honor the winged demigoddess Aviana.\n\nAviana found her way to G'Hanir, the Mother Tree, a fount of life that was the first thing Freya created within the Emerald Dream.\nShe grew enchanted with it, as it was more than a tree; it was a source of life, healing, and peace.\nAviana spent years melding her power into the tree, and soon all winged creatures of Azeroth dreamed of spending the afterlife flying through its branches.\nHer spirit became tied with G'Hanir, and in time this would have lasting consequences.\n\nWhen the red dragon Korialstrasz, trapped in his mortal disguise Krasus, was unable to fly, Aviana gifted him a feather which granted him temporary wings.\nDuring the War of the Ancients, Aviana was one of many Ancient Guardians who came to the aid of the night elves in defense of their world.\nThough the shock of their attack initially gave them an edge, the endless numbers of the Burning Legion eventually overwhelmed many of them.\nAviana was knocked from the sky and Rhonin witnessed her lifeless body fall when a large group of demons attacked her.\nThe doomguard surrounded her and pierced her body with their spears. When Aviana was killed, her realm tree G'Hanir died.\nThe first druids found her body among the carnage, and bore it up to the highest mountain. She was laid to rest just outside the Shrine of Aviana, within a circle of sacred stones.\n\nFor ten thousand years Aviana drifted formless in the Emerald Dream while the mortal races continued to worship her; the Druids of the Talon in particular focused their worship around her and learned to take the forms of raven and crows.\nHer children, the harpies, descended into violence and barbaric behaviour, and eventually forsook their parent for other, darker masters, or struck out on their own.\nSome worshippers believed Aviana to have survived her death at the hands of demons, and others claimed to have actually had contact with her.\nHowever, this is unlikely, unless it was through the Emerald Dream.\nAlthough G'Hanir died when she did, Aviana was able to give mortal druids a branch from the tree.\nIts connection to the Emerald Dream serves as a healing and stabilizing influence on Azeroth."}
{["title"] = "Grove of Aessina"		,["x"] = 19.46	,["y"] = 37.46	,["scale"] = 1.5,["lore"] = "The Grove of Aessina is a small grove devoted to the greater wilderness spirit of Aessina.\n\nAessina is one of the greater wilderness spirits who lurks in dense untamed woods.\nShe is the soul of the forest, its beating heart, the source of life energy that breaks down stone, devours ancient ruins, and fills dense thickets with mystery and fear.\nAessina is the center of the web of life.\n\nAessina is Ysera's everlasting companion, both in the Emerald Dream and the physical world.\nThe Ancient of Lore named Nordu was Aessina's \"dearest old friend\", and was likely so for most of the eons of his existence until his death at the hands of fire elementals from the Firelands."}
{["title"] = "Sanctuary of Malorne"	,["x"] = 26.90	,["y"] = 63.01	,["lore"] = "The Sanctuary of Malorne is an ancient shrine to the demigod Malorne that was destroyed by the invading elementals.\n\nThe earliest record of Malorne is in the tauren myth The White Stag and the Moon.\nIt describes how Malorne, being hunted by the tauren, bargained with Elune in exchange for help.\nMalorne accepted Elune's help and loved her as part of the deal.\n\nAnother version of the tale says that Malorne fell in love with the goddess of the moon during the world's first nightfall.\nHer light guided him through the woods and showed him he was not alone. It banished fear and brought hope.\nMany creatures have loved the moon and pursued her to madness.\nShe grants light as she will, on her own timetable, and moonlight cannot be captured or possessed.\nEven so, night after night, the White Stag chased her across the skies.\nHe grew so swift and strong that at last he succeeded in reaching her.\nShe was so moved by his devotion and beauty that she made him her consort.\nTo this day he loves the wilds best when they are lit by her radiance.\n\nWhatever the truth may be, eventually Malorne became Elune's consort. Elune gave birth to Cenarius from that relationship.\nBecause Ysera the Dreamer agreed to act as Cenarius' foster mother, she has often been mistaken for the demigod's true mother.\nAs a result, there are also rumors that she and Malorne had a romantic relationship.\nHowever, such rumors are baseless, though Ysera had a deep affection and respect for the demigod.\nHe was one of nature's mightiest champions and a frequent visitor to the Emerald Dream.\n\nDuring the War of the Ancients, Cenarius appealed to Malorne and the other demigods of Azeroth to join the battle against the Burning Legion.\nAfter much debate, Cenarius persuaded them to unite under the command of Captain Jarod Shadowsong, who was leading a large army of night elves and other creatures against the Legion.\nCenarius had gone into a frenzy seeing Ursol, Ursoc, Aviana, and Agamaggan die.\nCenarius crushed hundreds of felguards and felhunters. The demons finally got hold of Cenarius, but before the demons could slay him, Malorne came into the fray blinding all demons with his majestic white flashing body.\nMalorne's hooves crushed many demons, while his antlers killed many others.\nMalorne defended his son Cenarius, and with a look toward the elves as if telepathically commanding them to come for his son, Jarod Shadowsong and others dragged Cenarius to safety.\n\nMalorne's fury might have begun to turn the tide against the Burning Legion, had Archimonde not appeared.\nBlack lightning struck the land around Malorne, baking it, then green fire from the ground engulfed Malorne, burning at his coat, while the land and rock formed giant hands that pinned his four legs to the ground.\nArchimonde swelled in size matching Malorne's height.\nMalorne freed himself from his magical trap, and charged Archimonde with his antlers, causing tremors and lightning as demons and Azeroth' races nearby shook and fell to the ground flat on their backs with astonishment.\nMalorne and Archimonde battled for some time, until, finally, Archimonde managed to seize Malorne and with great force snapped his neck.\nCenarius's brave rescuer and father, limp and lifeless, was tossed aside by Archimonde.\nMalfurion knowing Cenarius was unconscious and that Archimonde had just slain Malorne, cast a spell that engulfed most of Archimonde's body with vines.\nThe Archdemon, analytical as always, decided to retreat by vanishing in a green flare of flames that consumed the vines.\n\nShortly thereafter, Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Soridormi, along with their dragonflights, joined the War of the Ancients.\nYsera came to a screeching halt at the sight of Malorne and opened wide her brilliant jade eyes (one of only a few times she did so in recorded history) with a deafening shriek.\nAs she tore through the carnage to her friend, thousands of demons were thrown in all directions with her paws and wings.\nHer rampage continued, making her way through to her goal, until she came still, her chin on Malorne's head; sobs could be heard as She of the Dreaming mourned the White Stag's end."}
