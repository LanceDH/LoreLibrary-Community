== Golden Stair

After the gateway was opened the mogu took the opportunity to invade the vale taking claim to the stairs and building a camp to prevent the doorway from being closed.
They guard the area with cannons, constructs, cloud serpents, and even the undead.

After the subsequent destruction of much of the vale as well as the releasing of the Sha of Pride, the mogu that once guarded the area have all been slain by the sha.
