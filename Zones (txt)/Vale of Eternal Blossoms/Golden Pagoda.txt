== Golden Pagoda

Found between the two gigantic mogu statues overlooking the western half of the vale, the zone once housed the Golden Pagoda itself.
When the mogu invaded the vale, the pagoda became a meeting place for the Golden Lotus.

When Garrosh Hellscream awakened the Sha of Pride, feedback from the event destroyed the Golden Pagoda and surrounding areas, and killed many of the Golden Lotus resident there.
The area is now a desecrated crater, home only to the sha that now haunt the vale.
