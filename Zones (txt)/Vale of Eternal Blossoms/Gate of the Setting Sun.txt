== Gate of the Setting Sun

The Gate of the Setting Sun is the gate of the Serpent's Spine, the great wall that is meant to isolate the mantid from the rest of Pandaria.
Guarded by the Shado-Pan for the last 10,000 years, to their surprise the swarm of the mantid occurs ten years earlier than it is supposed to.
The mantid have mustered a enormous army to lay siege to the Gate.
If the Gates fall, the mantid will swarm through Pandaria, causing death and destruction.
