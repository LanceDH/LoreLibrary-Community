== Ragefire Chasm

Beneath the city of Orgrimmar lies this fiery chasm.
A clan of troggs known as Ragefire Troggs had begun to appear in the chasm, from deep below the lava-filled tunnels.
Magatha the Seer, of the tauren people, attempted to make peace with these creatures, but was met only with hostility.
It was clear that these troggs were not interested in diplomacy, and could potentially overwhelm the entire Horde if left unchecked.

A sect of the mysterious Shadow Council had also taken refuge in this chasm.
This sect is known as the Searing Blade, and was led by Taragaman the Hungerer, a felguard; Jergosh the Invoker, a powerful warlock; and Bazzalan, a satyr.
From their dark hiding place, they plotted to overthrow and destroy all that the Horde has built for themselves in these lands.

After the Shattering, the Dark Shaman were formed and overtook Ragefire Chasm.
They cleared the presence of Searing Blade cultists and troggs, and used the latter to feed the enslaved beasts they brought from the Firelands.
Although Warchief Garrosh Hellscream called on a number of shaman to use the elements as weapons against the Alliance, the chasm's inhabitants appear to be renegades.
Reports have surfaced that these shadowy figures are amassing a blistering army that could wreak havoc if unleashed upon Orgrimmar.
