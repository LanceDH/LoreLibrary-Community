== Grommash Hold

Grommash Hold is an enormous fortress located in the Valley of Strength in the orc capital of Orgrimmar.
It is named after the orcish hero Grom Hellscream, and serves as the administrative center of the Horde.

Before going hungry for power and being overthrown, Garrosh Hellscream, previous Warchief and son of Grom, resided here.
Now the new Warchief, Vol'jin, and his advisors reside here.
