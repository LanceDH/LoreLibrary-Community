== Valley of Spirits

Many parts of this valley sunk due to the Shattering and caused the large pool of water at the southern end to flow into the rest of the valley flooding a majority of it.
The two huts in that pool were destroyed and the area was given to the goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel, which they now call the Goblin Slums.

Most of the orcish building survived here and continue to be used by their previous residents.
The Darkspear trolls have since been allowed to use this valley to build and expand upon.
A tunnel to bypass the Goblin Slums was also dug through the mountain to the Valley of Wisdom.

Near the end of Garrosh's rule, the district was put under martial law by the Kor'kron under orders from Garrosh himself due to the heavy troll population.
This was due to the recent rebellion against Garrosh's rule.
Curfews were put in order, and Kor'kron guards actively patroled the district and arrested all suspicious individuals.
Since his downfall, the Valley of Spirits has returned to its normal state.
