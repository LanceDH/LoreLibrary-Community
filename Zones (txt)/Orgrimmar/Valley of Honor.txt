== Valley of Honor

The Valley of Honor is the location for all things having to do with warfare in Orgrimmar.
The Ring of Valor arena is located here.
The Hall of the Brave houses the warrior guild, as well as all the city's battlemasters.

The Shattering has caused the land to shift in the valley.
This shifting has destroyed the once secluded pool of water and form a larger lake that flows throughout the valley.

The orcs have blown through the northern section of the valley to create an entrance to Azshara.
