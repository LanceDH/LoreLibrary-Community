== Goblin Slums

The Goblin Slums is the new district in Orgrimmar for the goblin refugees of Kezan.
It connects to the Valley of Spirits, and is an oily, dirty place - just the way the goblins like it.

The space now occupied by the Goblin Slums was part of the Valley of Spirits prior to the goblins joining the Horde.
The trolls moved further north in the valley, while the goblins were given this part of the valley to use as their own.
The slums are presided over by Boss Mida, who was added as a result of the Trade Princess Movement.
Off-duty goblins can be found lounging around the pool area as well as waiting in line to withdraw their money from the bank, and off-duty Orgrimmar Grunts join them to converse and tell jokes.

There appears to be an oil-drilling operation within the lake, overseen by Environmental Engineer Linza; the surrounding area is filthy, with the pollution flowing downstream to the new Valley of Spirits.
