== Valley of Wisdom

The Valley of Wisdom was once the location of Grommash Hold, where Warchief Thrall once resided in Orgrimmar.
When the Cataclysm stuck much of the area changed as the land sunk in some places creating spots for pools to form.

A few remains of Grommash Hold can still be seen where the tauren were allowed to setup huts and take this valley for their own use.
The armor of pit lord Mannoroth, which once rested on a tree here is now gone and the tree was destroyed.
