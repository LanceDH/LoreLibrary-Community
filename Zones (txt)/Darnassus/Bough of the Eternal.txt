== Bough of the Eternal

The Bough of the Eternals is a tree in the Temple Gardens of Darnassus where the city's bank can be found within.
It is tree that grew into the shape of a bear with a bird on its back, the two basic druid animal forms.
The bear is also likely either Ursoc or Ursol, two of the Eternals that fought and died during the War of the Ancients.
