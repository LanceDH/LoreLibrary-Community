== Howling Oak

The Howling Oak, located in the night elf capital of Darnassus, is the new home of the Gilnean refugees after the fall of Gilneas.
It is dominated by a "worgen tree" very similar to Tal'doren in the Blackwald.

The tree, as its name implies, is an actual oak tree.
It was grown through the aid of the night elf druids from a seed taken from Gilneas.
It stands for all the Gilneans have endured, and all that their people accomplished.
