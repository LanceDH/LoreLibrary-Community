== Runestone Shan'dor

Runestone Shan'dor is one of the four remaining runestones in Quel'Thalas, located at the southern edge of Eversong Woods.
It has become deactivated, but can be reclaimed by using the energy from an arcane crystal.
The runestones were placed by high elven druids or magi to mark the boundaries of their new kingdom, Quel'Thalas, when the high elves had just found it.

These enchanted monuments created a magic barrier that prevented the trolls from penetrating into Quel'Thalasand to create a magical barrier that stopped the use of arcane magic from being sensed by the Burning Legion.
The Runestone Shan, when reactivated, is used to protect Eversong Woods from the effects of the Plague.
