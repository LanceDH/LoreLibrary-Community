== Ruins of Silvermoon

The area known as the Ruins of Silvermoon makes up the western half of Silvermoon City, the capital city of the blood elves and the former kingdom of Quel'Thalas.
It is split from the reconstructed eastern districts of Silvermoon City by the Dead Scar - the path taken by Arthas Menethil and the Scourge on their way to the Sunwell to resurrect the dead necromancer Kel'Thuzad.

The lack of energy from the Sunwell caused the high elf buildings in the Ruins of Silvermoon to fall apart.
