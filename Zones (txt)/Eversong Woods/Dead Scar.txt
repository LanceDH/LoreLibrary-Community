== Dead Scar

The Dead Scar is a path of Blight that runs through the Kingdom of Quel'Thalas.
During the Third War, the armies of the Scourge — led by the death knight Arthas Menethil, Crown Prince of Lordaeron — marched up this path from Lordaeron all the way to the Sunwell Plateau, killing everyone and destroying everything in its path.
The Dead Scar practically splits Quel'Thalas in half, all the way through Silvermoon itself.

Today, the Dead Scar remains in the rebuilt Quel'Thalas, as a reminder to all who live there of the horrors committed by the Scourge — and as an incentive to seek their destiny beyond the Dark Portal.
