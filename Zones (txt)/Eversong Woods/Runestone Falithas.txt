== Runestone Falithas

Runestone Falithas is one of the four remaining runestones in Quel'Thalas, located on the southern edge of Eversong Woods.
Of the four, it is the only one to remain completely intact and functional.
Runewarden Deryan tends to the runestone.
The runestones were placed by high elven druids or magi to mark the boundaries of their new kingdom, Quel'Thalas, when the high elves had just found it.

These enchanted monuments created a magic barrier that prevented the trolls from penetrating into Quel'Thalas and to create a magical barrier that stopped the use of arcane magic from being sensed by the Burning Legion.
The Runestone Falithas is now used to protect Eversong Woods from the effects of the Plague.
