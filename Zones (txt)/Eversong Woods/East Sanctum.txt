== East Sanctum

The East Sanctum is one of three arcane sanctums in Eversong Woods.
In ruins, it rests close to the Dead Scar.

Next to the sanctum is the blood elf researcher, Apprentice Mirveda.
She is trying to find a way to reverse the taint on the soil of the scar, but finds that it is irreversible.
