== Sunsail Anchorage

Sunsail Anchorage is a port located in western Eversong Woods that has been completely taken over by the Wretched.

A tall, three-story building is the only structure at the Anchorage.
In the center of the second story is a golden orb with an arm extending through the side of the building, through a slanted opening that curves up and around the building.
At the end of the arm is a curled loop.
It can be assumed, based on the construction and location of this building as well as the shape and placement of the opening the arm extends through, that this is intended to function as a sort of cargo crane or a boat lift for maintenance or unloading.
