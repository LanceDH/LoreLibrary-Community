== Tor'Watha

Tor'Watha is one of two forest troll areas of Eversong Woods. It is much larger than nearby Zeb'Watha.
At its eastern ridge once sat a colossal fortress of some kind with a massive set of gates.
The fortress was completely devoid of any inhabitants, and the forest trolls stayed in the camps below.
It was later deconstructed.
