== Westbrook Garrison

Westbrook Garrison is considered by some to be the last bastion of order heading west of Stormwind.
The barracks is located in Forest's Edge on the western end of Elwynn Forest near the border with Westfall.
Beyond the garrison lie the dry fields of Westfall, currently controlled by agents of the Defias Brotherhood and their dreaded mechanical harvesters.
South of the garrison the forest is full of gnolls.
Beyond, only a river separates Elwynn Forest from shadowy Duskwood.
The brave defenders of the garrison work night and day to protect the citizens of Elwynn from the dangers beyond the forest.
