== Jerod's Landing

Jerod's Landing is a boat landing on the Elwynn Forest bank of the Nazferiti River.
The landing has was taken over by the Defias Brotherhood, and they used it to smuggle stolen goods from Redridge to Klaven's Tower in Westfall.

With the fall of the Defias Brotherhood, they have subsquently lost control of this point and now the dock is operated independently by the Dockmaster.
