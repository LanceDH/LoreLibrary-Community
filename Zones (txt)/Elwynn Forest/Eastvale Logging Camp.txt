== Eastvale Logging Camp

Eastvale Logging Camp is located in the far east of Elwynn Forest, under the very shadow of Redridge Mountains north of the main road.
Orders for lumber are constantly streaming in from various buyers and the lumberjacks work against strict deadlines.
Because of its location in more hostile wilderness, wild animals are proving to be troublesome.
Wolves and bears in the area have become a menace, chasing off workers and threatening to cause delays in delivery deadlines.
The problem has become significant enough that the Stormwind Guard has become involved, recruiting adventurers to collect abandoned lumber and eradicate some of the aggressive wildlife.
