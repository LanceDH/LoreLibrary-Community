== Tower of Azora

The Tower of Azora is a small mage tower in eastern Elwynn Forest.
The tower is run by a number of servants of Azora, who all appear to be Gnomish, and who are in turn presided over by the Archmage of Azora, Theocritus.
The denizens of the tower are in a constant feud with the inhabitants of the Tower of Ilgalar in Redridge Mountains, ruled over by the evil sorcerer Morganth.
The two towers are constantly spying on one another through magical means.

An interview with the servants of Azora in the Gadgetzan Times reveals they are unable to wield magic and are somewhat resentful of the abilities of their master.
It also shows that many things straying too near the tower are adversely affected by its magical aura, so the servants often have to battle living buckets and mutant butterflies.
