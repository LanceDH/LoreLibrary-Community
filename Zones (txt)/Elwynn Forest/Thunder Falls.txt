== Thunder Falls

Thunder Falls is a narrow ravine, located in the mountains of north-western Elwynn Forest.
A steep path leading up to the ravine can be found on the right of Mirror Lake's waterfall where there is a small rural cottage overrun by Bandits.
If the river is followed it will eventually wind into another waterfall that empties near the border of Westfall.
The bottom of the waterfall can be reached from above by carefully navigating through the hilly terrain.

Thunder Falls is quite unusual in the sense that it is a ravine with double-sided waterfall ends.
The falls are fed by a third, inaccessible waterfall from the cliffs on the northern side of the mountains.
