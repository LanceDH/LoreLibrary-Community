== Hall of Blood

The Hall of Blood is the headquarters of the Blood Knights, an order of blood elf paladins serving as the backbone of the Thalassian army.

With the strong support of the Magisters and the blood elven guard force, the former of which had a hand in their creation, the Blood Knights rose from unproven and scorned beginnings to become a popular group within sin'dorei society.
They are led by their matriarch, Lady Liadrin, who was the first of their order.
