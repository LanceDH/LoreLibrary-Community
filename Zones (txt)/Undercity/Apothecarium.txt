== Apothecarium

The Apothecarium is the home of the Royal Apothecary Society, a large-scale organization of undead dedicated to eradicating the "taint of humanity" from Lordaeron.
This is where the Forsaken work to brew their newest plagues, as well as creating more powerful abominations to serve in their armies.
This area is the domain of Master Apothecary Faranell and his alchemist minions.

During the Battle of Undercity, the Alliance led by Varian Wrynn entered the Apothecarium and killed Putress here.
The king was horrified when he saw the laboratory.
