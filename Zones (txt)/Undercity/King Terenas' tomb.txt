== King Terenas' tomb

A memorial to king Terenas Menethil II, who was killed by his own son Arthas Menethil.
Although the memorial appears to be a stone tomb, it was shown that after his death, Terenas was cremated.
Furthermore, the urn containing his ashes was used to resurrect the Lich Kel'Thuzad.
It is unknown what happened to the King's remains after this point.

The memorial was crafted by the Alliance humans who once inhabited the old city, who risked everything to ensure that the memory of Lordaeron's last true king would not be forgotten.
