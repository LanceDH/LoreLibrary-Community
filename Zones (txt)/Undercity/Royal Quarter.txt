== Royal Quarter

The Royal Quarter of the Undercity contains the throne room where the Dark Lady Sylvanas Windrunner controls her burgeoning empire of undeath.
Bragor Bloodfist has been assigned to this area to keep tabs on the Dark Lady and report all activity to the Warchief.

The Dreadlord Varimathras was found here alongside the Dark Lady prior to the Battle for the Undercity, where he tried to overthrow her by controlling a substantial part of the Forsaken faction.
He was eventually faced and defeated by Thrall and Sylvanas.
