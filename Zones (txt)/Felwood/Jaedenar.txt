== Jaedenar

Jaedenar is an area in Felwood that has been completely taken over by a sect of the Shadow Council.
The site of what is now Jaedenar lies on a series of ancient night elf ruins and two druidic barrow dens, on the western edge of Felwood.
The Shadow Council and its warlock agents took up residence here with the aim of spreading the region's corruption to the neighboring Ashenvale, thereby continuing the legion's plans for the destruction of Kalimdor.
The druids of the Emerald Circle are focusing on eradicating this threat and removing all cultists from the area before they can succeed with their twisted goals.

Jaedenar is apparently named after the eredar and leader of the Burning Crusade, Kil'jaeden.
