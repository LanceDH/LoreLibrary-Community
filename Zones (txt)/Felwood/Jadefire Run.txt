== Jadefire Run

Jadefire Run was home of the most powerful satyr in Felwood.
The demons of Jadefire Run have seemingly abandoned the area in the Cataclysm and it has now been claimed by Whisperwind Healers.
Feronas Sindweller, a demon hunter, is under the impression the healers are nothing more than the demons in disguise.
There also appears to be more traditional demonic architecture in the Run.
