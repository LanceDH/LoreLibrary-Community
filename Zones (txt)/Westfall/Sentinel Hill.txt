== Sentinel Hill

Sentinel Hill has been recently reinforced with the return of Gryan Stoutmantle and the Westfall Brigade from the war in Northrend.
The King has sent supplies, troops, and tanks in hopes of rebuilding the former breadbasket of the kingdom and to house the citizens of Stormwind whose homes were destroyed.
From Sentinel Hill, the Westfall Brigade has been able to reclaim much of the lands, such as Moonbrook, the Furlbrow's Pumpkin Farm, and The Jansen Stead.
The town isn't finished yet, and cannot let the homeless that surround the town in yet.
