== Moonbrook

Prior to the coming of the orcs to Azeroth, Moonbrook served as the focal point of the farmlands of Westfall.
During the First War, Moonbrook and its sister town Goldshire were the final two towns to fall to the Horde prior to the razing of Stormwind Keep.
It was rebuilt following the Alliance victory in the Second War.

One prominent family from Moonbrook is the Cooper family, who lived in a residence in the western part of the town.
The nearby mine was overseen by Foreman Thistlenettle, a member of the Explorers' League.

Following successful efforts by the Defias to seize control of Westfall, Moonbrook was abandoned.
For a while, it was controlled by the Defias and used by them to access their main base of operations, the Deadmines.
Since the defeat of Edwin VanCleef and the fall of the Brotherhood, Moonbrook has become home to a large number of vagrants.
