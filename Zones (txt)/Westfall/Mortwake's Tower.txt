== Mortwake's Tower

Mortwake's Tower, formerly Klaven's Tower, named after its rogue Defias master Klaven Mortwake, lies at the southeastern edge of Westfall near the river.

SI:7 was previously scouting this mage tower for some time and sometimes covertly sought help from adventurous rogues to sneak in and gather intelligence.
It was a well known launching point for Defias activity such that it has also been called the "Defias Tower".
Klaven's Tower was being used, along with Jerod's Landing in Elwynn Forest, in the smuggling of stolen goods from Redridge.
