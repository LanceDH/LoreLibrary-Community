== Furlbrow's Pumpkin Farm

Furlbrow's Pumpkin Farm (formerly known as Furlbrow's Pumpkin Patch) was one of the many farms in Westfall taken over by the Defias Brotherhood and their mechanical harvesters.
The killing machines used to patrol the fields before the Cataclysm, with the Defias taking up residence in the farm buildings.
Farmer Furlbrow and his wife fled during that time to the road near the Jansen Stead in northern Westfall.

After the events of the Cataclysm, the Furlbrows have apparently met an untimely demise near the Jansen Stead, their deaths currently under investigation.
Their farm was claimed by the Homeless Stormwind Citizens, Transients and similar individuals who can be found throughout the area.
