== Serpent's Spine

As Lei Shen, first emperor of the mogu, began to unify his people under a single banner and subjugate the other races of Pandaria, he knew that the mantid would never bow to his authority.
He commanded his slaves to construct the Serpent's Spine, a magnificent wall that spanned the length of the empire.
It took many generations to build but Lei Shen knew that fear would motivate his subjects.
The fear of the mantid moved mountains, raised armies, secured his empire, and built his wall.

Recently, the mantid and the yaungol have laid siege to the wall, in an effort to break through to launch an assault on the lands east of the wall.
The mantid have managed to damage the wall at the border with the Valley of the Four Winds and started to unleash their deadly assault upon the land, mainly at Stoneplow.
The yaungol have made it past the Ox Gate and have started to settle in Kun-Lai Summit.
