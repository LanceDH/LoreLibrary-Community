== Shado-Pan Monastery

Located in Kun-Lai Summit, this mountain retreat serves as the home and training grounds of the mysterious Shado-pan clan, a ninja-like pandaren faction dedicated to protecting Pandaria.

War has spread across Pandaria, and the destructive conflict between the Horde and Alliance has led to turmoil in the majestic Shado-pan Monastery.
There, three malevolent entities--the Sha of Violence, the Sha of Hatred, and the Sha of Anger--have erupted from their prisons.
Although the Sha of Anger fled the secluded monastery completely, the remaining sha have begun wreaking havoc on the site's brave Shado-pan defenders.
