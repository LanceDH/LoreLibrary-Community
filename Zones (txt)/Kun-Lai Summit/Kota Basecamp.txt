== Kota Basecamp

Uncle Keenbean has established the Keenbean Kafa Co. at the basecamp, using it to collect and sell Kafa'kota berries, which only grow on the Kota summit.
However, Cousin Gootfur has been feeding the mountain goats Kafa'kota berries in a lazy attempt to collect seeds.
This has predictably backfired, as the mountain goats are now Kafa-Crazy, and the yetis living on Kota Peak that traditionally prey on the goats are now also Kafa-crazed.
