== Peak of Serenity

The Peak of Serenity is a hidden monastery and sanctuary located high in the north-central reaches of Pandaria's Kun-Lai Summit.
It serves primarily as a training ground and place of refuge for monks.

The Peak itself features several areas, including a large training ground, a hot spring, and shrines to each of the four August Celestials.
Each shrine hosts a group of monks studying the discipline or style of its respective Celestial; Niuzao the Black Ox, Xuen the White Tiger, Chi-Ji the Red Crane and Yu'lon the Jade Serpent.
Students of the Crane focus on academic learning over martial prowess, and as such can be found poring over ancient scrolls and texts rather than sparring.
