== Darnassus

<HTML><BODY><P>Darnassus is the capital city of the night elves of the Alliance.<BR/>
The high priestess, Tyrande Whisperwind, resides in the Temple of the Moon, surrounded by other sisters of Elune and her mate, the Arch-Druid Malfurion Stormrage.<BR/>
<BR/>
In the aftermath of the Third War, the night elves had to adjust to their mortal existence.<BR/>
Such an adjustment was far from easy, and there were many night elves who could not adjust to the prospects of aging, disease and frailty.<BR/>
Seeking to regain their immortality, a number of wayward druids conspired to plant a special tree that would reestablish a link between their spirits and the eternal world.<BR/>
With Malfurion Stormrage missing, Fandral Staghelm â€” the leader of those who wished to plant the new World Tree - became the new Arch-Druid.<BR/>
In no time at all, he and his fellow druids had forged ahead and planted the great tree, Teldrassil, off the stormy coasts of northern Kalimdor.<BR/>
Under their care, the tree sprouted up above the clouds.<BR/>
Among the twilight boughs of the colossal tree, the wondrous city of Darnassus took root.<BR/>
Darnassus was built to honor the survival of the night elven race.</P><BR/>
