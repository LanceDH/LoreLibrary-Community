== Rut'theran Village

Rut'theran Village is an outpost port for the night elf city of Darnassus, located at the very bottom of the great tree Teldrassil.
There is a portal here that goes directly into Darnassus, as well as three docks with regular boats going to Exodar and Stormwind City.

Rut'theran Village originally had just one dock connected to Auberdine in Darkshore.
During the Shattering, several parts of the village were destroyed and Auberdine was destroyed as well.
Some of the services in Rut'theran Village were relocated to other parts of the now shattered island, and docks were added for the destinations previously reachable from Auberdine.
