== Grove of the Ancients

The Grove of the Ancients is a sacred ruin of an old night elven temple, where Onu, an Ancient of Lore, resides.
The grove was shielded from most of the devastation caused by the Cataclysm, due in large part to the power of the ancient guardians residing therein.
These guardians bonded together to form a living structure around the grove.
Protecting the grove required an enormous amount of energy, though, and as a result, most of the guardians have gone into a sort of slumber.
