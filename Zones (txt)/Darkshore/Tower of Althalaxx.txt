== Tower of Althalaxx

In the time of the Great Sundering, Queen Azshara brought her favored servitors, those of the Highborne, to the twin towns of Ameth'Aran and Bashal'Aran.
To govern these towns, Azshara placed Athrikus Narassin, an elf of considerable magical power.
Athrikus was at first loyal to his queen, but eventually he grew bored of his post, and would spend most of his days in the Tower of Althalaxx, some ways removed of the towns.

Approximately 10,000 years later, a dark theory about the Tower of Althalaxx has proven true: A cult gathered at the mage tower with many warlocks amongst their number, including a foul satyr.
They called themselves the Cult of the Dark Strand, and Athrikus was indeed their leader, although why they were assembling at this time was at first a dark mystery.

As it turned out, this cult was controlled by the Shadow Council.
Athrikus was eventually defeated, but even when he was long since dead, Forsaken looters led by Teegan Holloway continued to scour the area for the remains of his work.
Additionally, during the conflict between the Shatterspear tribe of trolls and the night elves of Darkshore, Shatterspear shaman have been seen in the area led by Lorenth Thundercall.
The Shatterspear have since been discovered to have allied with the Horde and attacked the tower, killing all of the cultists and burning it to the ground.
