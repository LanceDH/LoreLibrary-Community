== Ruins of Mathystra

Mathystra used to be a night elven city before the Great Sundering, but it was utterly decimated by the destruction of the Well of Eternity, and has long since been abandoned by the night elves in favor of the smaller coastal villages further south.

The ancient ruins were inhabited for a time by the Stormscale Naga, who aggressively guarded against any intrusions from outside sources.
After the Shattering, Shatterspear trolls destroyed the nearby Tower of Althalaxx, and stationed themselves in the ruins, staging an attack to Lor'danel.
They established the Shatterspear War Camp next to the ruins.
Several night elves are now scouting the area to learn about the trolls intentions and movements.
