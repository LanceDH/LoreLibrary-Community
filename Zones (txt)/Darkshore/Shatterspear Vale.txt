== Shatterspear Vale

The Shatterspear trolls are friendly to the Horde and were originally neutral to the Alliance until the escalation of hostilities following Garrosh Hellscream's takeover as the new Warchief of the Horde.
These once peaceful villagers of Shatterspear Vale have since then come under siege by the forces of the nearby Night Elves of Darkshore, after they joined the Horde by invitation of the new warcheif who sent a batallion of horde enforcers helping the trolls to construct several fortifications in the nearby area outside the vale, including the Shatterspear War Camp, all in preparation for an assault on Lor'danel.
