== Ruins of Auberdine

Following the Cataclysm, the Ruins of Auberdine are all that remains of the night elf port town of Auberdine after Deathwing flew over it.
The buildings here are wrecked and desolated, the former dock plunged into the sea.
A refugee camp for the former residents has been set up to the southeast.
