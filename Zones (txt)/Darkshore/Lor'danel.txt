== Lor'danel

Lor'danel is a seaside night elf settlement in northern Darkshore, founded by refugees from Auberdine after its destruction by the Shattering.

Despite it's coastal location, Lor'danel does not have a dock as Auberdine did.
Instead the ship between Auberdine and Stormwind now docks in Teldrassil.
