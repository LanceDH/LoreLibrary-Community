== Crystal Hall

The Crystal Hall is an area of the Exodar.
The shaman trainers can be found here, as well as a small crystal-digging mine full of Broken workers.
Note that the shamans are not all draenei; there are also furbolg and broken shaman around, including the most important one, Farseer Nobundo, located at the small elevated platform in the zone.

An interesting fact is that the draenei harvest crystals in the northern portion of the hall, where Broken draenei miners use their mining picks to gather the precious gems.
The crystals are used to repair the Exodar.
The Broken draenei, though still draenei in some regard, seem treated like a lesser class; a labor and task force.
It is kind of odd that a race with such an attachment to the Light treats those who were once their own people with such distaste.
It is possible that the arrangment was agreed to by the Broken draenei; their bodies better suited to manual labor than the "pure" draenei.
