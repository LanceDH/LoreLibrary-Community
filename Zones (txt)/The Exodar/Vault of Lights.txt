== Vault of Lights

The Vault of Lights is the favorite haunt of the Prophet Velen.

The Vault is notable for its central area, which looks like a set of purple holograms of various mobs.
It is in fact a museum or tactical information data bank of several Burning Legion units.
Occasionally a draenei tour group strides from one hologram to another.
As these group approaches various hologram emitters, the emitters state facts about the particular unit, namely the name, the species, its affiliation, and its function.
