The goal of this folder is lore checking.
In this folder are completed zones broken up in different files.
As their name implies the files called _Zone Lore contain overall lore of a zone. (unlocked by unlocking all locations in a zone)
The other files are the different locations in a zone.

With this folder I'd like to offer people a less technical way of helping out, offering their lore knowledge.
- Fact checking: Making sure all the lore is actually correct.
- Grammar checking: While more lore comes straight from Wowpedia, better safe than sorry.
- Formatting: Mainly for zone lore, but making sure every piece of text has a title, etc.
- 4th wall: Making sure no lore breaks the 4th wall; no mention of 'player', vendors, or other game terms

For a good example on zone lore I'd like to point to the Ashenvale lore.
It may not be perfect in itself, but if will give you a good idea.
