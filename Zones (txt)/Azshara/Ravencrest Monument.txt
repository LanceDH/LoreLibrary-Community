== Ravencrest Monument

The Ravencrest Monument mark the remains of a huge statue in Azshara.
Located southeast of the Ruins of Eldarath, what is left of the time-worn statue rests atop cliffs on the tip of Azshara's southern point, overlooking the Great Sea.

Undoubtedly an impressive site long ago, the statue now lies in ruins.
Only the broken-off legs still stand, with various other parts scattered on the ground around them.
Presumably, the rest has become buried, or sunk beneath the waves of the sea below.

Very little is actually known about the statue as its knowledge has been lost over the many thousands of years.
Many speculate it was raised in honor of Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest, however its location and female features go against this theory.
It is therefore assumed the statue was build for another Night Elf names Ravencrest.
