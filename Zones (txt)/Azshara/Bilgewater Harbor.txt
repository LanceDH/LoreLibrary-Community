== Bilgewater Harbor

From its roots as a humble \"city-in-a-box\" to the bustling metropolis it is today, Bilgewater Harbor straddles the line between myth and legend.
At least, that's what the brochure says. The orc commanders might argue differently, though.
It isn't exactly easy to maintain discipline in an otherwise lawless city where every vice you can imagine is available for just a handful of silver and debauchery is half off.

This goblin harbor settlement was built on an island in the Bay of Storms in Azshara and acts as a naval port for the entire Orgrimmar fleet, used to launch boats and zeppelins to carry out Garrosh's vision for the future of Kalimdor and beyond.
The majority of Bilgewater Harbor inhabitants are refugees from Kezan and the Lost Isles.
The town is roughly divided in half between the military side and the civilian side.
Skull and crossbones signs warn those who inadvertently cross from one side to the other.
The town’s origins are often speculated on by non-goblins; Bilgewater Harbor sprang up in record time after the Kezan refugees’ arrival, and its’ quintessentially goblin construction has fostered an atmosphere of debauchery and disorder.
Orgrimmar’s military has only recently set boots down in Bilgewater, but the harbor’s value as a strategic front conflicts with some pushy goblins’ desire to turn it into a new version of their ancestral home (abounding with gambling dens, pleasure houses and other commercial luxuries).
This cultural rift is likely to breed tension in the ranks of the Horde sooner rather than later.

Because the Goblins' home city of The Undermine has suffered irreparable damage, Bilgewater Harbor can be seen as their temporary capital city.
