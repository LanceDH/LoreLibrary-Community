== Darnassian Base Camp

Darnassian Base Camp was formaly known as Thalassian Base Camp.

Several fairly low-ranking Highborne Night elves have taken over the camp from the hostile Blood elves that were once there.
Under the leadership of Lorekeeper Amberwind, they are dealing in and attempting to research arcane magic.

The blood elf Andorel Sunsworn wants them dealt with and remarks on the relative ineptitude of the night elf magi, notably their use of an Arcane Construct which the high elves of the Eastern Kingdoms had banned 1500 years ago, and further asserting that the kal'dorei lost the area ten thousand years ago.
