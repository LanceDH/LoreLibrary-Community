== Ruins of Eldarath

During the War of the Ancients, a battle was fought here between the Kaldorei Resistance and Burning Legion.
Tichondrius was fought by Jarod Shadowsong and Huln Highmountain.
The Great Sundering caused most of the city to crumble to the Bay of Storms below.
A cluster of ruins clings to the eastern cliffs, long shunned by night elves.
Ferocious bands of naga appear to have claimed Eldarath for their own.
Lord Kassarus controls the remaining ruins from the Temple of Zin-Malor.

The temple was once a prominent night elven temple devoted to the worship of their goddess, Elune.
It has at least one undergound royal vault, which contains a chest of pandaren design, the last gift the pandaren gave to the highborne before cutting ties with the night elves.
The pandaren said it contained all the arcane magic the highborne would ever need, but was in fact completely empty.
The gift was actually a message of advice and wisdom to the highborne: that they did not actually need arcane magic at all.

After the Cataclysm, the ruins turned into a full blown war zone between its naga inhabitants and the goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel, who want to turn it into beach front property.
