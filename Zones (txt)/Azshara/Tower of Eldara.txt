== Tower of Eldara

The Tower of Eldara was once part of the extensive night elven civilization that stretched across most of what is now called Azshara.
It is located on the very tip of land northeast of the Bay of Storms, and the sandy beaches near the tower are heavily patrolled by murlocs, makrura, and hydras.
The tower itself stands closed and abandoned.
