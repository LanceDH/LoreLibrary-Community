== Mountainfoot Strip Mine

Mountainfoot Strip Mine is a very large mine in Azshara, providing recourses for the Horde.  
The mine is however overrun by basilisk and Night Elves, disturbing the workflow.

Before being turned into a stripmine, the area was known as the Haldarr Encampment, a Night Elven ruin.
