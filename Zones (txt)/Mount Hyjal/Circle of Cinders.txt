== Circle of Cinders

When Ragnaros was ripped from the Elemental Plane by the Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan, several subjects from the Firelands followed in his wake.
Baron Geddon fought against the titans and aided in the betrayal of Thunderaan, Prince of Air.
The Firelord devoured the essence of the prince, but was unable to consume him entirely.
Thus, the remaining energies were trapped within a talisman of elemental binding, which Ragnaros split into two perfect halves which he gave to his two lieutenants.
Rumour has it that Executus supplanted Baron Geddon, and the two have been rivals ever since.
Although this rumour has yet to be confirmed, there is certainly no doubt that Ragnaros does not tolerate failure.
Thus, the lesser flamewakers (and, of course, Baron Geddon) eagerly awaited a misstep by Executus, anticipating their chance to vie for the coveted attention of the Firelord.

Baron Geddon guarded one half of the talisman deep within the fiery confines of Blackrock Depths.
Though the two have fought side by side for countless millennia, Baron Geddon harbored suspicious that Garr would seek to supplant him as the sole guardian of the talisman.
Geddon, therefore, remained ever cautious of his former comrade.
In fact, it was Shazzrah who sought to posses both halves of the talisman so that he might find a way to siphon its energies for his own use.

Geddon also taught a fire elemental by the name of Lord Incendius to harness his destructive powers, but the baron never expected his protégé to grow so lethally efficient.
Increasingly wary that Incendius might usurp him, Geddon sent the blazing elemental out of the Molten Core to guard the Dark Iron dwarves' fabled Black Anvil.

Some years after the defeat in the Molten Core, Baron returned with Ragnaros' assault on Mount Hyjal.
