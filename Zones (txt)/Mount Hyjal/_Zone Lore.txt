== Pre-Sundering ==

The Kaldorei have long held this great mountain sacred.
When the first Well of Eternity was destroyed in the first demonic invasion, the resulting implosion triggered the sundering.
Mount Hyjal endured, however, and the night elves emerged to rebuild their society — though without arcane magic this time.

One of the fleeing night elves — Illidan Stormrage, brother to the mighty druid Malfurion Stormrage — had taken a portion of water from the Well of Eternity.
Illidan could not bear to live without the Well's magic.
After the Sundering, he poured this water into a lake at the peak of Mount Hyjal, creating a second Well of Eternity.
The night elves were outraged at this act, for it was the first Well's energies that originally brought the demons to Azeroth.
Illidan was imprisoned, and Malfurion met with three great dragons to create the World Tree Nordrassil.
The World Tree grew over the Well to obscure and protect it.
In the centuries that followed, the night elves were a constant presence, nurturing and protecting the World Tree that stood in the valley between the twin peaks of Mount Hyjal.
The Burning Legion targeted the World Tree during the Battle of Mount Hyjal, but, infused with the combined power of Azeroth's mortal races, it blasted Demon Lord Archimonde into oblivion and freed the world of the demon menace.

== Cataclysm ==

The Twilight's Hammer and fire elemental forces of Ragnaros attacked Mount Hyjal with the intent of burning down Nordrassil.
The Guardians of Hyjal revived Goldrinn, Aviana, and Cenarius from the Emerald Dream, as well as saved Tortolla from imprisonment at the Twilight's Hammer's hands, and fought off Ragnaros.
Hyjal later served as the invasion point for Cenarion Circle's attack on the Firelands.
