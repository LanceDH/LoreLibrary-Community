== Shrine of Goldrinn

The Shrine of Goldrinn is a shrine built to honor the wolf god Goldrinn, or Lo'Gosh in orcish.
Lo'Gosh is an Ancient Guardian, one of several demigods on Azeroth.
He takes the form of a monstrously powerful white wolf and embodies ferocity, savagery, and an unyielding will.
Goldrinn was worshipped by the Druids of the Scythe, who helped create the Scythe of Elune using one of Goldrinn's fangs and the staff of Elune.
They intended to use the scythe to tame their feral spirits, but were instead transformed into bestial, humanoid worgen.

Goldrinn was already ten thousand years old when the Burning Legion first invaded Azeroth.
The white wolf Ancient slaughtered hundreds of demons before he fell in the invasion.
He is said to have aided the night elves of Eldre'Thalas in holding their city against the Burning Legion, only to vanish after battle, never to be seen again.
His legend extends throughout Azeroth to elves, trolls, goblins, tauren, and dwarves — who all have their own version of the story.
In each tale, the ancient's unyielding will and sheer ferocity enabled him to push through the boundaries of the afterlife to aid his people.
This may be metaphorical however, since Tyrande 's vision, which recounted the events of Goldrinn's death, depicts his mortal wolf progeny continuing his legacy by pressing on the fight against the Burning Legion after he fell in battle.

His \"spirit\" seems to live on, favoring and inhabiting the human king, Varian Wrynn.
It is suspected that Goldrinn not only admired Varian's ferocity, but also his ability to tame it; something he himself was never able to do.
Whereas Goldrinn's noble heart was overshadowed by his desire for bloodlust and vengeance, Varian's ferocity was tempered by his desire to protect and uphold justice.
His choice to champion Varian seems to be another last redeeming act to Elune.
