== Darkwhisper Gorge

Darkwhisper Gorge is an area being used as a Twilight's Hammer recruitment and training spot.
The area is found in the southeastern part of Mount Hyjal.
The Twilight's Hammer managed to take the gorge from the Burning Legion by force and have held onto the territory with only one exception, the Gates of Sothann, which was taken by a pit lord and his army.
