== Grove of Aessina

The Grove of Aessina is a small grove devoted to the greater wilderness spirit of Aessina.

Aessina is one of the greater wilderness spirits who lurks in dense untamed woods.
She is the soul of the forest, its beating heart, the source of life energy that breaks down stone, devours ancient ruins, and fills dense thickets with mystery and fear.
Aessina is the center of the web of life.

Aessina is Ysera's everlasting companion, both in the Emerald Dream and the physical world.
The Ancient of Lore named Nordu was Aessina's \"dearest old friend\", and was likely so for most of the eons of his existence until his death at the hands of fire elementals from the Firelands.
