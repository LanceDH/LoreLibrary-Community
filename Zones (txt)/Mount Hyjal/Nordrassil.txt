== Nordrassil

Nordrassil, meaning \"Crown of the Heavens\" in Darnassian, was grown from an acorn of the recently lost Mother Tree, G'Hanir, by the great dragon Alexstrasza in the waters of the newly reborn Well of Eternity on the sacred Mount Hyjal.
After that she blessed the tree with strength and vitality, which also extended the night elves.
Ysera's blessing upon the tree bound it and the elven druids to the Emerald Dream, allowing them to enter her realm freely where before it required difficult meditation.
But the most important blessing came from Nozdormu, which ensured that so long as the tree existed the night elves would remain immortal.
This would ensure that even the most corrupt of night elves would be drawn to protect the tree.

During the Battle of Mount Hyjal, Malfurion Stormrage blew on the Horn of Cenarius to summon forth hundreds of nature spirits to defeat Archimonde, thereby sacrificing the night elves' immortality and causing a devastating shockwave, which heavily damaged Nordrassil.
Fandral Staghelm led the creation of Teldrassil as a means to regain the immortality blessing of Nordrassil, but this did not work as it was dependent on Nozdormu.
