== Pools of Vision

The Pools of Vision were mysteriously being haunted by a powerful Earth Elemental.
Cairne Bloodhoof was hesitant to drive it away because he wanted to understand what has disturbed it first, so as to discover what has disturbed the natural balance of Azeroth.
The gladiator champion named Lo'Gosh was able to defeat it and cleanse the Pools of Vision.
Magatha Grimtotem glorified Lo'Gosh's victory in order to discredit Cairne for being unable to cleanse the elemental from the Pools of Vision.
Some time later the pools were used by Stasia Fallshadow.
