== Silverwind Refuge

The corpses of some of the previous inhabitants still lie on the ground around the outpost.
The main building that functions as an inn is night elven and has a beautiful view on the lake that borders it.
It should also be noted that the Horde have set up logging operations in the surrounding area and have begun to clear the forest.

The surviving night elves have fled to nearby Stardust Spire and vow revenge for the loss of the outpost.

The night elves thought Silverwind to be impenetrable, with its heavy defenses and their army of water elementals.
However, during the Horde attack one of their mages was able to summon a twisted elemental designed to send the others into a chaotic rage.
With the enraged water elementals attacking all they saw before them, victory was assured for the Horde.
