== Zoram Strand

The Zoram Strand is a stretch of beach in the northwest corner of Ashenvale.
While the Horde have set up Zoram'gar Outpost in the Zoram Strand, the area has fallen to the naga.
The dark creatures have taken up residence, evident in their numbers and in the shipwrecks and beached sea creatures along the shore.

Near the area there was originally a night elven town called Zoram but is long destroyed and submerged beneath the seas.
