== Xavian

Xavian is one of the three Ashenvale satyr settlements, the other two being Satyrnaar and Night Run. Of the three, Xavian seems to be the center of satyr political power in Ashenvale, as both Prince Raze and Geltharis live here..

It was here that, during the War of the Satyr, general Xalan the Feared was killed, the most successful general of the satyrs.
