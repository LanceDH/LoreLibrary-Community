== Splintertree Post

Due to its location nearby the Warsong Lumber Camp, it is possible that Splintertree was once established and occupied by Grom Hellscream's Warsong troops during the Third War when the orcs first ventured into Ashenvale.
The night elves, still on uneven ground with the past actions of the Warsong leader and with the strain on the Horde/Alliance Peace agreements from the last war, Splintertree was to a high amount of retaliation, especially since raids on Astranaar were frequent.
