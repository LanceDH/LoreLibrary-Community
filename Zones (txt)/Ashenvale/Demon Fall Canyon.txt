== Demon Fall Canyon

This canyon is famous for being the site of a titanic clash between the demonic pit lord Mannoroth, and two orcs named Grom Hellscream and Thrall.
Although the pit lord succeeded in knocking Thrall out, he was not quick enough to escape Grom's axe, which cleaved into Mannoroth's chest.
The demon's death created an explosion of fire and light, which tore the life from Grom as well.
A memorial stone has since been erected in Grom's memory, and it stands to this day in the canyon amidst hostile lesser demons.
