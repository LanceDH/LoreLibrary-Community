== Bough Shadow

Bough Shadow contains one of the portals to the Emerald Dream.
The great tree was planted by followers of Fandral Staghelm from one of Nordrassil's branches in order to stem the tide of saronite seeping up from the land.

The portal is guarded by the green dragons Phantim and Dreamstalker, along with other dragonkin.
