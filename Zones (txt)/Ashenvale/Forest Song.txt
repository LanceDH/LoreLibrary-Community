== Forest Song

orest Song is located in northeastern Ashenvale, just northeast of Satyrnaar, north of the Warsong Lumber Camp, and southwest of Bough Shadow.
It is an ancient Kaldorei ruin, formerly almost abandoned, where the usual forest sounds are still.
Currently, Forest Song is inhabited by a band of night elves and draenei who are building an outpost there.
The fortifications are being put up in order to help the Silverwing Sentinels defend the area from the Warsong clan and the Burning Legion forces in the area, and to attempt to reclaim some of the damaged areas, like Felfire Hill.
