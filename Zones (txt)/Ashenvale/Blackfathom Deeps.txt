== Blackfathom Deeps

Situated along the Zoram Strand of Ashenvale, Blackfathom Deeps was once a glorious temple dedicated to the night elves' moon goddess, Elune.
However, the Great Sundering shattered the temple - sinking it beneath the waves of the Veiled Sea.
There, the temple remained untouched until naga and satyr, drawn by its ancient power, emerged to plumb its secrets.

Legends hold that Aku'mai, a favored pet of the primordial Old Gods, has taken up residence within the temple's ruins.
The cult known as the Twilight's Hammer has also come to bask in Aku'mai's evil presence - and members of the shamanic order known as the Earthen Ring rush to oppose them, knowing that where the Old Gods are invoked, dangers to the whole of Azeroth cannot be far behind.
