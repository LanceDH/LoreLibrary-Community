== Stormrage Barrow Dens

The Stormrage Barrow Dens are the sacred Barrow Dens of Moonglade where many of the Night Elf Druids slumber in the Emerald Dream.
The great druid Malfurion Stormrage, for whom the Barrow Dens are named, used to slumber deep within the dens.

During the Third War, Malfurion was awakened by Tyrande to help fight Archimonde's forces.
He was sleeping in his Barrow Den and was almost destroyed by the Dreadlord Tichondrius' forces.
