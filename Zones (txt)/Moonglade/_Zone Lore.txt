The Moonglade was the druids' home for thousands of years.
When the Burning Legion ran rampant over the land in ancient times, the Moonglade remained untouched.
The night elf druids went into deep meditation in the secure caves of the Barrow Dens, sending their minds into the plane of the Emerald Dream.
The remaining night elves built the town of Nighthaven.
During the Third War, the Moonglade again remained the safe haven of the elves.
Tyrande from here waked Malfurion.
Although battles were fought there, the land was not befouled.
Before Teldrassil was created, the Moonglade housed the majority of the Night Elven population.

The Gold Road once reached all the way to Moonglade and Nighthaven, but with the corruption of Felwood it became very isolated as strangers are no longer welcome by the Timbermaw furbolgs.
Recently, the peace in Moonglade itself has become threatened as bizarre creatures from the Emerald Nightmare have found a way into a wing of the Stormrage Barrow Dens.
