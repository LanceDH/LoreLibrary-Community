== Kharanos

Kharanos is a bustling little town nestled among the mountain peaks of Dun Morogh. The town is surrounded by the stark wintry wilds of Dun Morogh, so adventure is a common commodity.
Kharanos is home to a large forge, a gnomish workshop, and the famous Thunderbrew Distillery, where adventurers can sit down and drink some of the best ale available in the world.

For all its quaint charm, Kharanos is a hub of military activity, defending against all manner of threats in the region.
Directly to the west is a large cavern inhabited by fierce Wendigo.
To the northwest, the Frostmane trolls have entrenched themselves at Shimmer Ridge.

Once, a giant frostame troll attacked the town and almost every dwarf.
Only Lazlo Grindwidget was able to defeat the troll thus he was honored as a hero of Kharanos.

During one of the earthquakes preceding the Shattering, the Distillery was damaged and High Priest Rohan, Anduin Wrynn, and Aerin worked hard to help the injured and free the trapped.
After clearing out the first floor an aftershock hit Kharanos, causing the remains of building to fall into a sinkhole.
Aerin, Anduin's friend and protector, was in the building when it fell into the earth and died with the others that were still inside.
Anduin used all his strength to try to save her from underneath the rubble, his fingers were bloody and his strength diminished, crying for surrounding dwarves and draenei to help him, until he passed out from exhaustion.
After the shattering, the Brewery ws rebuild.
