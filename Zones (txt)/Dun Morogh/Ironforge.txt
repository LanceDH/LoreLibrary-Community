== Ironforge

<HTML><BODY><P>Ironforge is the capital city of the dwarves, a member of the Alliance.<BR/>
It is the ancestral home of the Bronzebeard dwarves.<BR/>
The Council of Three Hammers rules the kingdom of Khaz Modan from the throne room within the city.<BR/>
<BR/>
Carved into the stone heart of Khaz Modan, the mighty city of Ironforge is a testament to the dwarvesâ€™ strength and resilience.<BR/>
The city is perhaps the most intricate of the Alliance cities, boasting many small passageways, shops built into the rock walls, and cavernous rooms.<BR/>
The feel of the city is a bustling, rowdy, and somewhat industrial one.<BR/>
However, it is predominantly safe-feeling and cozy; fires roar in the hearths of the inns and shops, and much dwarven laughing and frivolity is to be heard.<BR/>
Also, unlike Stormwind and Darnassus, the city is actually a massive cavern carved into the earth by the dwarves; the ceiling and floor are both hard stone.<BR/>
<BR/>
Mainly because of the Deeprun Tram, linking Ironforge and Stormwind City, and the district of Tinker Town, Ironforge is one of the most racially diverse cities in the Alliance world.<BR/>
Dwarves predominate, of course, but you will find plenty of gnomes even outside of Tinker Town, and probably as many humans.<BR/>
You will find almost no night elves however, as they probably prefer more natural and open spaced environments.<BR/>
With the Council of Three Hammers uniting all three dwarven clans, Ironforge has recently welcomed Dark Iron dwarves and Wildhammer dwarves into Ironforge as well.</P><BR/>
