== Ironforge Airfield

The Ironforge Airfield is an airfield located in a high mountain valley northeast of the dwarven capital city of Ironforge.
It has two landing strips, and several gnome pilots are there standing next to their planes or tinkering with them.
Around the airfield, there are a series of dwarven buildings and structures.
Mountaineers from Ironforge patrol the area, and some members of the Stormpike Guard can be found here too.
North of the airfield there is a gryphon roost, but it only connects to Gol'Bolar Quarry via a Flying Machine.
