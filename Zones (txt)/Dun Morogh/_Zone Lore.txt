Centuries ago, the Dark Iron dwarves split from their Ironforge brethren, summoning Ragnaros and devastating the land in the process.
The warriors of Ironforge drove the Dark Irons to near extinction, and the few survivors fled deep underground in the Blackrock Mountain to their fiery lord.
In the fourth year since the opening of the Dark Portal, Dun Morogh's dwarves and gnomes joined the Lordaeron Alliance in the Second War.
Ironforge dwarves and gnomes were key in the Horde's defeat, and many nurse grudges against orcs to this day. Not long ago, gnomes in Gnomeregan unearthed the mythic troggs.
These tribal creatures slaughtered Gnomeregan's populace and drove the gnomes to Ironforge, where they hide and nurse their wounds.
This catastrophe explained why Ironforge gnomes did not take part in the Third War.
The troggs also proved an excellent distraction for Ironforge's forces, allowing the Frostmane trolls to invade Dun Morogh in an attempt to reclaim their ancient lands.

The snowy peaks of Dun Morogh have been the home of the dwarves and gnomes for centuries.
The two races have generally lived on friendly terms, trading between their own respective cities, Ironforge and Gnomeregan.
During the Second War, both races joined the Alliance of Lordaeron after the orcs invaded Khaz Modan.
Their service proved invaluable to Alliance forces, and between dwarven brawn and gnomish brains, the orcs never succeeded in taking either capital.
During the intervening period between the wars the gnomes and dwarves grew closer together, working jointly on a number of major projects.
Since the destruction of Gnomeregan, the remaining gnomes have been forced to flee and seek protection within Ironforge.
This peaceful region is now threatened by the troggs who have begun appearing all over the area.
