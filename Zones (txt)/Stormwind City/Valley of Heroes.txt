== Valley of Heroes

The Valley of Heroes is a valley that lies before Stormwind Gate. A bridge of stone crosses the narrow moat and is the first sight of all who enter. 

Statues of Alliance heroes stand on either side of the road, welcoming visitors while providing an awe-inspiring warning. These heroes comprised the Alliance Expedition that travelled through the Dark Portal into Draenor to seal the dimensional rift from that side.
On the left are Kurdran Wildhammer, Thane of Aerie Peak, and the Archmage Khadgar of the Kirin Tor; on the right are Force Commander Danath Trollbane and Ranger-Captain Alleria Windrunner; at the end of the main road, just before it splits to enter Stormwind City proper, is General Turalyon, the expedition's military leader.
