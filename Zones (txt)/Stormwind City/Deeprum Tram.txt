== Deeprum Tram

King Bronzebeard turned to Azeroth's most esteemed engineer, High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque, who immediately began drafting designs for a grand subterranean railway system that would link Stormwind and Ironforge.
His vision has become reality, and the newly-built Deeprun Tram has developed into an indispensable link between the two great capitals, providing swift and safe transportation for thousands of their citizens, and bolstering military cooperation between the armies of these two proud Alliance strongholds.

Shortly after the petrification of Magni, Moira invaded Ironforge and closed the tram, isolating the dwarves in the city. Some time later, Varian led an elite strike team of SI:7 agents through the tram into Ironforge.
