== Stormwind Park

The Park used to be the district located in the western corner of Stormwind City. It was once a district devoted to leisure activities for Stormwind's populace until it became a refuge for visiting night elves, who found the comforting presence of nature a welcome respite from the vast stone thoroughfares of Stormwind proper. It was the only place in the Eastern Kingdoms where druid trainers resided. The night elves created a Moonwell in the center of the park square.

The Park was destroyed by Deathwing's visit to Stormwind, during the Shattering. When he attacked the city, the druid trainer Sheldras Moontree, priest trainer Nara Meideros, and Argos Nightwhisper were the only ones known to escape alive, with the rest unaccounted for. They have relocated down to Stormwind Harbor. All that remains of the Park are the ruins of The Old Barracks.
