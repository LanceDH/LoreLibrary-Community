== SI:7

SI:7, which stands for Stormwind Intelligence, is a secretive branch of King Varian's forces. It includes rogues specializing in special operations, espionage, assassination and stealth tactics.

The organization is currently led by Master Mathias Shaw. They have operatives all throughout the Eastern Kingdoms who carry out secret missions for Stormwind, such as Renzik "The Shiv" and Flint Shadowmore. They also have some operatives in the Kalimdor region, such as Andello Porter.

The black stallion is rumored to be favored by the SI:7 for night missions due to its dark coat.
