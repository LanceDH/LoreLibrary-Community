== Stormwind Stockade

Stormwind Stockade is a high-security prison complex, hidden beneath the canal district of Stormwind City.
Presided over by Warden Thelwater, the Stockade is home to petty crooks, political insurgents, murderers and a score of the most dangerous criminals in the land.

A large number of dangerous criminals, including some criminal masterminds and Defias mercenaries, are currently being held in the stockade.
However, not so long ago, there was a revolt inside the dungeon, and the prisoners now keep the Stockade under their control.
