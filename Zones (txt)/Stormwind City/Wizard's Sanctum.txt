== Wizard's Sanctum

The Wizard's Sanctum, or Academy of Arcane Sciences, is a vine-covered tower that sits to the west of Stormwind City. For a long time, the Academy was considered to be a second-best school of magic compared to Dalaran, but since that region's destruction by the demons and undead, the northern mages fled to Stormwind and took up residence in the tower. It's full to bursting with mages, and some say it's difficult to get a word in edgeways with the differing opinions inside. Yet as it's the only magic school left in the east, few complain openly.

Seemingly led by Maginor Dumas, the magi here strive to decipher arcane mysteries and uncover eldritch lore. Larimaine Purdue, the resident portalmancer, has created a rift portal deep in the Sanctum. She keeps the portal under close guard, and for now, will not let anyone venture through its swirling vortex. It is unknown where it leads to.

The Sanctum houses Stormwind wizards' guild, the Academy of the Arcane Sciences, and is currently one of the foremost centers of human arcane research and study today. Many high elves also seek refuge in the arcane halls, quenching their addiction and thirst for power in a safe environment.
