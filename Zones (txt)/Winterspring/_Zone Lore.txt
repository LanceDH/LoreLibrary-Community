During the events of the Third War the valley was in a rare period of springtime or summer with no snow to be seen anywhere.
All, Thrall's Horde, Alliance remnants, Scourge, night elves and corrupted satyrs made camps here.
Tyrande and Malfurion destroyed one human camp and the satyr and awakened the druids of claws.
