== Winterfall Village

Winterfall Village is a large village of corrupted furbolgs in the far eastern area of Winterspring near Everlook.
The village was ruled by High Chief Winterfall, who resided in a small cave at the very top of the settlement.
It appears that High Chief Winterfall's position has been taken by Grolnar the Berserk, and now resides in the former chief's cave.
