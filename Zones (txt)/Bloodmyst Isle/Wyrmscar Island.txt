== Wyrmscar Island

Wyrmscar Island is now home to bones, the restless spirits of slain green whelplings, and the ghost of Prince Toreth, a night elf prince of Loreth'Aran.
Razormaw was a lieutenant of Deathwing who lead the destruction of Loreth'Aran, resulting in the death of both Night Elf and Green Dragons.  
His hatred is so great he remains on the island even in death.
