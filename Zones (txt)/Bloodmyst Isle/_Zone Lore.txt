Bloodmyst Isle has little historical information related to it.
Originally known as Silvergale when the draenei first landed, it was once as beautiful as nearby Azuremyst Isle.
The island was corrupted by blood red crystals from the draenei's dimensional ship, the Exodar.
Blood-like liquid seeps from many of the crystals into the ground.
The corruption from the liquid caused creatures and plants to become irradiated.
The air was polluted with red-tinted mist from the red liquid. Due to the corruption the island was renamed \"Bloodmyst\".
The island has for a long time lain out of view from central Kalimdor, and has largely been left to itself by the neighboring tauren and night elves.
It is likely that this is why many enemies of the night elves, such as satyrs and naga, have found a haven here.
When the Exodar crashed on Azuremyst Isle, several large pieces of the dimensional ship fell on Bloodmyst.
These pieces are now used both by the draenei and by other creatures as a form of shelter.
