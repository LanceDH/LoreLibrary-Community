== Old Ironforge

After Magni Bronzebeard received earthen-related stone tablets from Brann in an attempt to learn about the pre-Cataclysm disturbances, Magni ordered the sealed gates of Old Ironforge to be opened for a ritual.
The key took two dwarves to lift, and it took a ladder for them to reach the lock.
After venturing through the door, a linear path led Anduin, Muninn Magellas, Advisor Belgrum, High Priest Rohan and Reyna Stonebranch to a large cavern.
A surprisingly new-looking carpeted path led upwards to a broad platform capable of holding a large group, and an unadorned stone path led downwards.
With an incantation scroll and a potion, Magni performed the ritual.
While listening to the incantation, Anduin called this place the "heart of the earth".
The ritual seemingly worked, but turned him into a solid diamond statue.
