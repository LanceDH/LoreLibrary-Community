== Tinker Town

Originally, Tinker Town was just a small quarter of the city for gnomes visiting from Gnomeregan to use.
When their clockwork city of Gnomeregan fell, it became the center of the gnomish court in exile (the Gnomeregan Exiles).
Prior to the partial retaking of Gnomeregan, High Tinker Mekkatorque could be found here, along with his closest advisers.
